###Goal inputs over Goal outcomes 

I'm changing how I think about goals. My insight is to focus on goal inputs and relax focus on the outcome. 
Why: I spent the last four years founding, building and shipping amazing products. 
I know how to set ambitious goals. I'm reasonably disciplined and I have an incredible ability to stay focused. 

The challenge is to keep showing up with sustained enthusiasm. 
What I know about me is that I like wins - small wins, big wins, it doesn't matter. 
The key is to come up with a set of inputs I can move. Then show up and do it everyday. 

For instance, I wake up and meditate everyday. Even if it's for five minutes, I show up. 
At the end, I celeberate my appreciating my win. Then I record it in Apple Notes. 
This shows me that I do what I say I will and when I look back, I see how far I've come. 
I notice the benefits that have compounded from this meditation practice. Clarity, focus and calmness. 

If I had set out a goal to "develop a daily meditation practice", the vagueness would have killed it. 
"Meditate for at least 15 minutes per day" is doable. I find I always go over the minimum commitment. 
Afterwards, I give myself a  ‚≠êÔ∏è or a üëë.
With treats like these, you bet I'm showing up again tomorrow. 

*I'm publicly committing to these goal inputs for the next month:*
* Publish at least one video and post two pieces of short form writing every day 
* Write at least one long form post per week 
* Talk to atleast five users each week
