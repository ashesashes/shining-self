###Focus on what works 

Whenever I feel resistance, I like to focus on what works.

It sounds simple but it's not always easy. 

Let's say, I'm having one of those mornings. The ones that either start off with a sense of anxiety or something you can't quite name. Or the ones that implode midday and everything goes downhill from there. 

When that happens, I remind myself that I have a choice. 

I can focus on what works. And feed it with my attention. 

Anything that you feed with intention grows. 

Try it. 

Pick a small thing that's already working. 
Maybe you decided to get 5 minutes of sunlight today? üî• 
Maybe you had a wonderful breakfast? ü•Å 
Maybe you got out of bed this morning? ‚≠êÔ∏è
Woohoo! Win! Win! Win! 

How many more wins can you rack up? 

Everytime I do this, I feel buoyant. I feel clarity. I feel limitless. 

The more I focus on what works, the more what works shows up. 

The more it shows up, the more I focus on it. 

That's a self-fulfilling loop that works like magic. 

Leave "vive la resistance" to the revolutionaries.
