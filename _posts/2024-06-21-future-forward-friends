###Future forward friends 

Everyone deserves future forward friends. 

Like many people, I believed that friendship was a product of similarity, proximity and shared goals. 

That's a good start but it's not everything. 

Now, I believe that its your shared values, interests and a desire to grow together that's more important. 

And there needs to be a certain mutuality, equality and reciprocity in the relationships. 

It's not enough to simply place loyalty where it isn't valued or deserved. 

These days I ask myself the question, do my friends light a spark in my heart? 

Do I feel more energized, supported and inspired? 

And am I able to authentically be myself? 

I now find myself around optimistic, solutions oriented, likehearted friends who inspire me. 

My ambition and interests are not tolerated. They are celebrated. 

I feel encouraged and supported. And I can support and encourage. 

We're able to pick up where we left off with ease. 

There's nothing quite like it.
